This repository contains reflected headers from Blue Fire that would be able to be used in projects but the project name of Blue Fire.uproject prevents literally anything from being compiled which is really annoying.
Besides that the headers can be viewed to find stuff you may not be able to find with parsing.

If you do not have V5.0.5 of Blue Fire, then either update or if on the amazon games version use the [amazon games patcher](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MmhrzQuAyoAI455vEfJnM6sArhFXL3x5/view?usp=sharing) to update it
